[{"UID":"SJgob6NKvH","abstract":"Obtaining policies that can generalise to new environments in reinforcement learning is challenging. In this work, we demonstrate that language understanding via a reading policy learner is a promising vehicle for generalisation to new environments. We propose a grounded policy learning problem, Read to Fight Monsters (RTFM), in which the agent must jointly reason over a language goal, relevant dynamics described in a document, and environment observations. We procedurally generate environment dynamics and corresponding language descriptions of the dynamics, such that agents must read to understand new environment dynamics instead of memorising any particular information. In addition, we propose txt2\u03c0, a model that captures three-way interactions between the goal, document, and observations. On RTFM, txt2\u03c0 generalises to new environments with dynamics not seen during training via reading. Furthermore, our model outperforms baselines such as FiLM and language-conditioned CNNs on RTFM. Through curriculum learning, txt2\u03c0 produces policies that excel on complex RTFM tasks requiring several reasoning and coreference steps.","authors":"Victor Zhong|Tim Rockt\u00e4schel|Edward Grefenstette","keywords":"nlp|reading comprehension|reasoning|reinforcement learning","session":"","title":"RTFM: Generalising to New Environment Dynamics via Reading"},{"UID":"rkg-TJBFPB","abstract":"Exploration in sparse reward environments remains one of the key challenges of model-free reinforcement learning. Instead of solely relying on extrinsic rewards provided by the environment, many state-of-the-art methods use intrinsic rewards to encourage exploration. However, we show that existing methods fall short in procedurally-generated environments where an agent is unlikely to visit a state more than once. We propose a novel type of intrinsic reward which encourages the agent to take actions that lead to significant changes in its learned state representation. We evaluate our method on multiple challenging procedurally-generated tasks in MiniGrid, as well as on tasks with high-dimensional observations used in prior work. Our experiments demonstrate that this approach is more sample efficient than existing exploration methods, particularly for procedurally-generated MiniGrid environments. Furthermore, we analyze the learned behavior as well as the intrinsic reward received by our agent. In contrast to previous approaches, our intrinsic reward does not diminish during the course of training and it rewards the agent substantially more for interacting with objects that it can control.","authors":"Roberta Raileanu|Tim Rockt\u00e4schel","keywords":"curiosity|reinforcement learning","session":"","title":"RIDE: Rewarding Impact-Driven Exploration for Procedurally-Generated Environments"}]
